## Unity Projects

* **Force Feedback Leap Test**: Initial project to test Leap Motion tracking inside Unity.

* **Force Feedback Optitrack**: Contains official Motive-Unity plugin. Need to run this project first to open NET port on Motive.

* **MotiveDirect-master**: Actual project containing working demo. Using XmanLCH's [*MotiveDirect* repo](https://github.com/XmanLCH/MotiveDirect) for Motive-Unity intergration.

**Additional files**:
Both *MixedRealityToolkit-Unity-2018.9.0-Beta* and *MixedRealityToolkit-Unity-Examples-2018.9.0-Beta* are Unity Packages to intergrate Acer's Mixed Reality Headset (or any MR from Microsoft) into Unity. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity)
