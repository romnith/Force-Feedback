Direct Unity C# client for Optitrack Motive
============

This is a NatNet direct client running in Unity written in C# that allows you to receive tracking data sent from the OptiTrack Motive software directly without intermidiate NatNet SDK server or plug-in. Mostly rewritten from PacketClient.cpp in NatNet SDK and [Optirx](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/optirx).

If you just want to see your tracked object appears in Unity, use this. If you want to reduce the tracking network load, use this.

## Usage

There are two easier ways to move your 3D model/gameobject. 

1. Use Gameobject.Find([name]) and let your 3D model/gameobject follows it. 
2. Name your 3D model/gameobject as the same name as the rigidbody in Motive. The system then will move your 3D model/gameobject instead of creating a new one.
